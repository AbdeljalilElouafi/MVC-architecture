# MVC-architecture


## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a clean, modular, and extensible Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for PHP-based web applications. It serves as a base structure that can be adapted to various web applications, with a focus on best practices such as separation of concerns, code reusability, and security.

The goal of this architecture is to offer a reliable foundation for developing scalable and maintainable web applications, by leveraging modern PHP features and design patterns. The project emphasizes the separation of different application layers (model, view, controller), while also addressing essential aspects such as security, authentication, routing, and data validation.

## Key Features

This MVC architecture is equipped with the following key features:

1. **Advanced Route Management**  
   A custom router is implemented to manage URL routing efficiently, allowing flexible route definitions and handling dynamic parameters.

2. **Secure Database Connection**  
   The project connects securely to a PostgreSQL database using PDO (PHP Data Objects) to ensure safe and optimized database queries, with protection against SQL injection attacks.

3. **Front Office and Back Office Separation**  
   The architecture distinguishes between the public-facing sections of the website (Front Office) and the administration area (Back Office), ensuring proper security and role management.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   A secure authentication system is implemented using sessions and tokens to manage user logins. Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to manage permissions for different user roles in the system.

5. **Role and Permission Management**  
   Advanced access control lists (ACL) are included to define and manage user roles and permissions, providing a customizable access management layer.

6. **Template Engine Integration**  
   The architecture uses the Twig template engine to separate the logic from the presentation layer. Twig is used for rendering views, ensuring a clean and maintainable front-end codebase.

7. **Dependency Injection and Service Management**  
   Dependency Injection is employed to inject the necessary services into controllers and models, promoting a decoupled and testable application structure.

8. **Security Features**  
   The project includes robust security features such as:
   - **SQL Injection Protection:** Using prepared statements with PDO for secure database queries.
   - **XSS Protection:** Sanitizing user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - **CSRF Protection:** Implementing anti-CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

9. **Error and Log Management**  
   A logging system is implemented to capture application errors and events, which aids in debugging and monitoring.

10. **Data Validation**  
    A dedicated validator class ensures all user inputs and data are validated before being processed or stored, ensuring the integrity of the application.

11. **Session Management**  
    An advanced session management system is implemented, providing secure and reliable session handling across the application.

12. **URL Rewriting and .htaccess Security**  
    A `.htaccess` file is included to rewrite URLs and enforce security measures, ensuring clean, user-friendly URLs and protecting sensitive files.
